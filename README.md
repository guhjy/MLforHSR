# Machine Learning for Health Services Researchers

This code accompanies the article 'Machine Learning for Health Services Researchers' in the journal Medical Care (2017). The article aims to provide a high-level overview of common machine learning methods used for outcome prediction in health services research. We first introduce common concepts and methods to prevent overfitting, improve generalizability, and perform validation. We then examine the pros and cons of different machine learning methods that are current and popular, based on literature review: (i) regularization methods applied to linear, logistic, or more complex algorithms, which help prevent over-fitting when many correlated variables can be included in a prediction algorithm; (ii) decision tree methods useful for estimating differences in outcome rates among subpopulations at particularly high- or low-risk for an outcome; (iii) deep learning methods to learn complex non-linear patterns or interactions in data; and (iv) ensemble methods to potentially improve prediction by combining multiple machine learning methods.
The code provided here in R and Python demonstrates the application of common machine methods to a simulated insurance claims dataset, to enable reproduction and extension of common methods.
