# Machine Learning for Health Services Researchers

Machine learning methods have been popularized as revolutionary approaches to decipher patterns, and make predictions, from large-scale data. Here, we provide statistical code to accompany our primer on machine learning methods for health services researchers. The primer specifically defines central machine learning concepts such as regularization, supervised versus unsupervised learning, boosting and bagging, and embedding. The primer examines the pros and cons of applying different machine learning methods to particular study situations faced by health services researchers, including the analysis of healthcare delivery metrics, changes in policies or interventions, and multi-level influences on health outcomes. The primer and this statistical code focuses specifically focus on on methods found to be most current and popular (as of 2017) in the health services research field, based on literature review: (i) regularization methods developed to improve variable selection, avoid overfitting, and improve generalizability of a regression model; random forest, gradient boosting machines, and related decision tree methods developed to sort data into subgroups, by identifying unique subpopulations at particularly high-risk for an outcome; (ii) deep learning and other neural networks developed to learn complex non-linear patterns in data for improved outcome prediction; and (iii) ensemble methods, developed to improve classification or prediction of an outcome by combining multiple machine learners. The linked statistical code above demonstrates the application of these methods to a simulated insurance claims dataset, to enable reproduction and extension of the methods we detail, and to facilitate extension of these methods by researchers to their own data.
